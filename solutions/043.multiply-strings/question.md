Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Example 1:


Input: num1 = &quot;2&quot;, num2 = &quot;3&quot;
Output: &quot;6&quot;

Example 2:


Input: num1 = &quot;123&quot;, num2 = &quot;456&quot;
Output: &quot;56088&quot;


Note:


	The length of both num1 and num2 is &lt; 110.
	Both num1 and num2 contain&nbsp;only digits 0-9.
	Both num1 and num2&nbsp;do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
	You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.
