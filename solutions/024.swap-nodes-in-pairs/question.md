Given a&nbsp;linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

Example:


Given 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4, you should return the list as 2-&gt;1-&gt;4-&gt;3.

Note:


	Your algorithm should use only constant extra space.
	You may not modify the values in the list&#39;s nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
